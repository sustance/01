A PASSENGER CAN BENEFIT FROM A HIGHER LIABILITY LIMIT BY MAKING A SPECIAL
DECLARATION OF VALUE AT THE LATEST AT CHECK-IN AND BY PAYING A SUPPLEMENTARY
FEE.

COMPLAINTS ON BAGGAGE
IF THE BAGGAGE IS DAMAGED, DELAYED, LOST OR DESTROYED, THE PASSENGER MUST
WRITE AND COMPLAIN TO THE AIR CARRIER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  IN THE CASE OF
DAMAGE TO CHECKED BAGGAGE, THE PASSENGER MUST WRITE AND COMPLAIN WITHIN SEVEN
DAYS, AND IN THE CASE OF DELAY WITHIN TWENTY-ONE DAYS, IN BOTH CASES FROM THE
DATE ON WHICH THE BAGGAGE WAS PLACED AT THE PASSENGER'S DISPOSAL.

LIABILITY OF CONTRACTING AND ACTUAL CARRIERS
IF THE CARRIER ACTUALLY PERFORMING THE FLIGHT IS NOT THE SAME AS THE
CONTRACTING CARRIER, THE PASSENGER HAS THE RIGHT TO ADDRESS A COMPLAINT OR TO
MAKE A CLAIM FOR DAMAGES AGAINST EITHER.  IF THE NAME OR CODE OF A CARRIER IS
INDICATED ON THE TICKET, THAT CARRIER IS THE CONTRACTING CARRIER.

TIME LIMIT FOR ACTION
ANY ACTION IN COURT TO CLAIM DAMAGES MUST BE BROUGHT WITHIN TWO YEARS FROM THE
DATE OF ARRIVAL OF THE AIRCRAFT, OR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH THE AIRCRAFT OUGHT
TO HAVE ARRIVED.
