<p>We always travel via Bell Street rather than the freeways/tollways, so I think the Bell Street option is the better, especially as the other way can be choked with traffic heading to the city at that time of the morning.
</p>
<p>
The route you've got is fine, but if you want an easier option you should you travel along Bell Street 
much further, right out to the intersection with Rosanna Road and Lower Heidelberg Road in Heidelberg.
</p>
<p>  
Turn right here into Lower Heidelberg Road, follow it round lots of curves and through a cutting, veering
 left into Burke Road North, which becomes Burke Road once you've crossed over the Eastern Freeway.
</p>
<p>  
Travel along Burke Road,  turn left into Canterbury Road, - there's a large church on the left hand 
corner - and follow Canterbury Road, round a bend with a park on the right, through some traffic lights 
with Canterbury Gardens on the right, under a railway bridge, then the next intersection with traffic 
lights is Union Road.
</p>
<p>  
Go over Union Road and immediately turn left into Peppercorn Place - there's an Ultratune service centre 
on the nearest corner and a large building painted light green on the far side.   
You've arrived - our place is the large grey building on the RHS of Peppercorn Place.
</p>
<p>
You'll possibly find that there's nowhere to park in our lane, so if that's the case, just park across our garage doors, leaving enough room for thru traffic, and ring the bell at our gate.  
When you've unloaded we'll give you a visitor's pass for the rest of the day, and you'll be able to move your car into the space opposite your accommodation after 5pm - we'll show you where.
